# Unit-tests
The project is an implementation of array and object methods and unit tests for these methods. [Here is a link to the task](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/js-fe-course-en/blob/main/tasks/unit-tests/unit-tests.md). There are methods implementation in the project task folders and test realization in the test folders. Utility functions for methods realization are also added to the project in the root folder. These functions are in types-checking.js, common-functions.js and error-checks.js files.
